# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## About

* This is my initial submission for Project 3 for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. 
* Starter code (art assets and game engine) was provided by Udacity, you can see it [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game). 
* The main requirements included: to write will be object-oriented functions (either class functions or class prototype functions, to use the "this" word appropriately. See full project specifications in the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) provided.

## Instructions

* You don't need to do anything to run the game, just head to its github page [here](https://curiouscc.github.io/P3-Classic-Arcade-Game-Clone/).
* The rules are: (1) avoid collision with the enemy bugs, (2) to move use the up, down, left, right keyboard arrows, (3) you win if you reach the top blue / water line. (4) If you crash with a bug, you will start over.
